# Interactive Game-Based Breathing Trainer
## Project Overview
This project presents an interactive breathing trainer designed for children aged 6–12 with bronchial asthma. The system transforms traditional respiratory exercises into an engaging game-based experience using Arduino hardware and Python.
## Problem
Children with asthma often lack motivation to perform regular breathing exercises. Traditional therapy methods can be repetitive and unengaging.
## Solution
The system integrates:
- HX710B pressure sensor
- Arduino Uno
- Python-based game (Flappy Bird-inspired)
Instead of button control, the game is operated through controlled exhalation. Real-time breath pressure directly affects in-game performance.
## Features
- Real-time breath detection
- Gamified respiratory therapy
- Adjustable difficulty levels
- Designed for home and clinical use
## Hardware Components
- Arduino Uno
- HX710B Pressure Sensor
- Adjustable resistance breathing tub
